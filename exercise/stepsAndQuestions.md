#### Lab 04 Steps and Questions Regarding PubMed

---


Part 1: Goto: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ and perform a search across "All Databases" for ```SREBF1``` and you should be taken to a new page regarding gene results. Note: you should now be at the address: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=SREBF1


---

#### Questions:
##### 1. What do you see?


##### 2. From this page, what is SREBF1's full name?


##### 3. What other names does is gene have?


---


Part 2: Click on the ```Orthologs``` button on this page. Note: you should now be at the address: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6720/ortholog/?scope=7776

#### Questions:
##### 4. What page are you on now; what type of information do you see?


##### 5. From the description, in which chromosome does ```SREBF1``` originate?


##### 6. What are some of the other organisms in which this gene has been discovered?


---


Part 3: On the "Homo sapiens" row, find the column for "Gene" and click on the link for ```SREBF1``` to take you to the another page. Note: you should now be at the address: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6720/

#### Questions:
##### 7. What page are you on now; what type of information do you see?


##### 8. What other names does this gene also have?


##### 9. In the information on this page, the "lineage" meta data is given. What is this information?


---


Part 4: Locate the ```Genomic regions, transcripts, and products``` field of the page. Find the gene in green labeled as "NM_001005291.3",  and click on it. After your click, two other sequences (indicated by blue and red lines) have opened up beneath the green line.

#### Questions:


##### 10. What are the green, blue and red sequences? (i.e., How are these sequences connected?)


##### 11. When hovering the mouse over the sequences, a panel opens up containing important and fascinating information. What is meant by the ```Compliment locations``` of the green and blue lines?


##### 12. Using the RNA-seq exon coverage information towards the bottom of this graphical spread, offer a reason about why the the green and blue lines may differ in sequence length. Note, you may have to review the connotations of "exons" to make a clear argument for a differing length.

##### 13. Lucky number thirteen's question: Discussed in the lab assignment, Do *et al.* performed research on the SNP ```rs11868035```. Complete a PubMed search to determine what the alternative bases are for this particular SNP. Please ask questions as necessary!
