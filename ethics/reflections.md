#### Reflection Questions:

1. Explain at least two  very different ethical dilemmas that are likely to arise from contributing and diffusing unsubstantiated (i.e., unconfirmed) information to unknowing consumers.

2. Who are the victims (i.e., the "consumers") of the above two dilemmas? How are they negatively impacted?

3. What can be done to prevent misleading ideas from being incorporated into the lives of these consumers?

4. What does the following quote from the article mean to you; "Health conspiracy theories and false cures have polluted social media for years, abetted by companies that have been more focused on building out the plumbing than keeping the pipes clean of misinformation."
